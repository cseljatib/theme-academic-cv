abstract = "South America has the largest area of temperate forests in the Southern Hemisphere, which grow in diverse site conditions. The aim of this paper is to review the practices of silviculture applied and recommended for these temperate forests, and to discuss prospects to develop new silvicultural proposals to improve sustainability, adaptation and in-situ conservation of forest ecosystems. We reviewed the silviculture knowledge in four major forest types: 1) The *Nothofagus*-dominated forests of south-central Chile; 2) the Angiosperm-dominated evergreen forests; 3) the *Nothofagus* and *Austrocedrus chilensis* forests in the Argentinean Northern Patagonia; and 4) the Cool temperate Nothofagus forests and Magellanic rainforests.
