> *I feel somehow like a mentee of these people*

I have been fortunate enough to work with professors and researchers that profoundly impacted the way I carry out my research activities and academic duties.


* *[Timothy G. Gregoire](https://environment.yale.edu/profile/gregoire/)*, Professor of Biometrics and Environmental Statistics, School of the Environment, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA. Prof. Gregoire was my advisor during my doctoral studies at Yale and always offered me a robust quantitative basis for understanding statistical inference and sampling.

* *[Albert Stage](http://www.john-bell-associates.com/itp/itpstage.htm)* (RIP), Chief Forest Biometrician, Forestry Science Laboratory, USDA Forest Service, Moscow, Idaho, USA. Dr Stage was my co-advisor during my Master of Science at the University of Idaho. He taught me mathematical details on forest modelling and philosophical points of view that are key to becoming a sound researcher.

* *[Andrew P. Robinson](https://researchers.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~apro@unimelb/)*, Professor of Applied Statistics, Schools of BioSciences & Mathematics and Statistics, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia. Andrew was my advisor during my Master of Science studies at the University of Idaho. 

* *[Oscar García](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Oscar_Garcia30)* (Retired), Professor of Forest Growth and Yield at the Northern University of British Columbia, Prince George, Canada. Professor Gargía’s work has been foundational in my interests in mathematical modelling in forestry.

* *[Brian Dennis](https://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/faculty/dennis)* (Retired), Professor of Statistical Ecology at the University of Idaho, USA. Professor Dennis’ motivated me to shift from the MS program in forestry to the statistical one. A decision that undeniably changes my academic career.

* *Patricio Núñez*, Professor of Silviculture at the Universidad de La Frontera, Chile. Professor Núñez taught me to apply quantitative
 methods for silviculture and forest ecology.
