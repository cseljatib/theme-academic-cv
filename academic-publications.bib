title={Evenness mediates the global relationship between forest productivity and richness},

abstract={1. Biodiversity is an important component of natural ecosystems, with higher species richness often correlating with an increase in ecosystem productivity. Yet, this relationship varies substantially across environments, typically becoming less pronounced at high levels of species richness. However, species richness alone cannot reflect all important properties of a community, including community evenness, which may mediate the relationship between biodiversity and productivity. If the evenness of a community correlates negatively with richness across forests globally, then a greater number of species may not always increase overall diversity and productivity of the system. Theoretical work and local empirical studies have shown that the effect of evenness on ecosystem functioning may be especially strong at high richness levels, yet the consistency of this remains untested at a global scale. 2. Here, we used a dataset of forests from across the globe, which includes composition, biomass accumulation and net primary productivity, to explore whether productivity correlates with community evenness and richness in a way that evenness appears to buffer the effect of richness. Specifically, we evaluated whether low levels of evenness in speciose communities correlate with the attenuation of the richness-productivity relationship. 3. We found that tree species richness and evenness are negatively correlated across forests globally, with highly speciose forests typically comprising a few dominant and many rare species. Furthermore, we found that the correlation between diversity and productivity changes with evenness: at low richness, uneven communities are more productive, while at high richness, even communities are more productive. 4. Synthesis. Collectively, these results demonstrate that evenness is an integral component of the relationship between biodiversity and productivity, and that the attenuating effect of richness on forest productivity might be partly explained by low evenness in speciose communities. Productivity generally increases with species richness, until reduced evenness limits the overall increases in community diversity. Our research suggests that evenness is a fundamental component of biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships, and is of critical importance for guiding conservation and sustainable ecosystem management decisions.},

abstract={Forest dynamics describe the change in structure and composition of forests over time, and is mainly driven by forest growth, a process resulting from size increase and mortality of trees, and recruitment of new individuals. An understanding of forest growth is essential for decision-making and research. An appropriate characterization of growth is only possible through the remeasurement of permanent sample plots over time. Although Chile has a continuous forest inventory system, it has several deficiencies which prevent the effective study of forest growth, mainly because it focuses on stand-level variables and stock estimates but lacks data for individual trees. Furthermore, access to the raw data is limited. In addition, maintaining long-term monitoring of plots to evaluate growth is difficult because of budget restrictions. These combined factors jeopardize the provision of key information regarding native forest dynamics and growth. We propose the establishment of a network of permanent sample plots in the Chilean National System of Protected Areas. Finally, we discuss a monitoring system based on this network by highlighting the advantages in terms of research, dissemination, outreach, and the ease of adding non-woody attributes.},

year = {2023},
date = {2023-02-01}, 
abstract={Relative growth rates (RGR) have both intrigued and irritated many plant scientists since they were proposed as characteristics of growth performance in the early 20th century. Particularly, the common trend of RGR to decrease with increasing size, also referred to as ontogenetic drift, has given rise to many debates and much criticism. In this study, we showed that, with plants that germinated at the same time, it is common to obtain a linear relationship between RGR and size for each survey year which -- when pulled together in one graph -- eventually form a system of cascading elliptical point clouds over time. This system of data point clouds reflects the well-known exponential decline of RGR with size, the aforementioned ontogenetic drift. Using 12 individualtree time series of Pinus radiata in Chile we studied the ontogenetic drift based on a new spatially explicit explanatory model allowing the reconstruction of individual-tree RGR trajectories. Favourable environmental conditions enforced the RGR decline over size and accelerated growth dynamics. Less favourable environmental conditions reduced the strength of the ontogenetic drift and slowed down growth. We also found that the model parameter estimates were more precise the stronger the RGR decline over size. Both, interpretable model parameters and evaluation characteristics, described the ontogenetic drift well. Interestingly, the slopes of the semimajor axes of the RGR-size data ellipses changed signs precisely at the time when smaller trees ceased to dominate population growth and larger trees started to contribute disproportionately to the overall growth processes.},

abstract={Spatial patterns reveal critical features at the individual and community levels. However, how to evaluate changes in spatial characteristics remains largely unexplored. We assess spatial changes in spatial point patterns by augmenting current statistical functions and indices. We fitted functions to describe unmarked and marked (tree size) spatial patterns using data from a large-scale silvicultural experiment in southern Chile. Furthermore, we compute the mingling index to represent spatial tree diversity. We proffer the pair correlation function difference before and after treatment to detect changes in the unmarked-point pattern of trees and the semivariogram-ratio to evaluate changes in the marked-point pattern. Our research provides a quantitative assessment of a critical aspect of forest heterogeneity: changes in spatial unmarked and marked-point patterns. The proposed approach can be a powerful tool for quantifying the impacts of disturbances and silvicultural treatments on spatial patterns in forest ecosystems.},

abstract={Growth equations have been widely used in forest research, commonly to assess ecosystem-level behavior and forest management. Nevertheless, the large number of growth equations has obscured the growth-rate behavior of each of these equations and several different terms for referring to common phenomena. This review presents a unified mathematical treatment of growth-rates besides several well-known growth equations by giving their mathematical basis and representing their behavior using tree growth data as an example. We highlight the mathematical differences among several growth equations that can be better understood by using their differential equations forms rather than their integrated forms. Moreover, the assumed-and-claimed biological basis of these growth-rate models has been taken too seriously in forest research. The focus should be on using a plausible equation for the organism being modelled. We point out that more attention should be drawn to parameter estimation strategies and behavior analysis of the proposed models. Thus, it is difficult for a single model to capture all possible shapes and rates that such a complex biological process as tree growth can depict in nature. We pointed out misleading concepts attributed to some growth equations; however, the differences come from their mathematical properties rather than pure biological reasoning. Using the tree growth data, we depict those differences. Thus, comparisons of some functional forms (at least simple ones) must be carried out before selecting a function for drawing scientific findings.},

I reconstructed height–age pairs by both algorithms. I fit height growth equations in a mixed-effects model framework for each species, using the generated data with the respective algorithm. Comparisons considered confidence intervals of the estimated parameters, as well as regression-based equivalence tests. Results showed that the fitted growth models obtained from both stem analysis algorithms were statistically equivalent. However, the proposed algorithm is simpler and thus provides a useful alternative to current methods. Based on the findings, I recommend using this new stem analysis algorithm to reconstruct tree height growth with stem analysis data.},

  abstract={Unique combinations of geographic and environmental conditions make quantifying the importance of factors that influence forest productivity difficult. I aimed to model the height growth of dominant Nothofagus alpina trees in temperate forests of Chile, as a proxy for forest productivity, by building a dynamic model that accounts for topography, habitat type, and climate conditions. Using stem analysis data of 169 dominant trees sampled throughout south-central Chile (35°50' and 41°30'), I estimated growth model parameters using a nonlinear mixed-effects framework that takes into account the hierarchical structure of the data. Based on the proposed model, I used a system-dynamics approach to analyze growth rates as a function of topographic, habitat type, and climatic variability. I found that the interaction between aspect, slope, and elevation, as well as the effect of habitat type, play an essential role in determining tree height growth rates of N. alpina. Furthermore, the precipitation in the warmest quarter, precipitation seasonality, and annual mean temperature are critical climatic drivers of forest productivity. Given a forecasted climate condition for the region by 2100, where precipitation seasonality and mean annual temperature increase by 10\% and 1°C, respectively, and precipitation in the warmest quarter decreases by 10 mm, I predict a reduction of 1.4 m in height growth of 100-yr-old dominant trees. This study shows that the sensitivity of N. alpina-dominated forests to precipitation and temperature patterns could lead to a reduction of tree height growth rates as a result of climate change, suggesting a decrease in carbon sequestration too. By implementing a system dynamics approach, I provide a new perspective on climate-productivity relationships, bettering the quantitative understanding of forest ecosystem dynamics under climate change. The results highlight that while temperature rising might favor forest growth, the decreasing in both amount and distribution within a year of precipitation can be even more critical to reduce forest productivity.},

Here, I develop a mathematical perspective for using height growth-rate at a reference-height as a new type of site index. I provide the mathematical basis for the proposed index and illustrate its application by fitting a nonlinear mixed-effects differential equation model to tree height growth data of three Nothofagus species in southern Chile. The proposed index allows us to foresee and analyze growth patterns, not only by representing growth-rates as a function of time but also of size. In doing so, the proposed index makes tree growth and productivity analyses accessible to a broader community of researchers.},

There are several challenges associated with individual-based mortality data, particularly observations with uneven measurement intervals. Here, we develop and examine several common individual-based mortality modelling strategies that simultaneously account for unequal measurement lengths and the hierarchical structure of the data in long-term, permanent plot data from the mixed Nothofagus forests in south-central Chile. These strategies depend on: (a) the functional model form (logit and Gompit), (b) the period length adjustment method (annualized, covariate, and exposure), and (c) the data structure used (traditional or all multiple combinations of the time series). Our findings indicated that the Gompit functional form outperformed the commonly used logit link function. Furthermore, considering the period length as exposure in a generalized linear mixed-effects model offered better goodness-of-fit than the other examined period length adjustments. Using all the possible combinations of the dynamic data did not improve the prediction capabilities of the model variants, but important differences were found in the statistical inferences of the fitted models. Our results highlighted that understanding tree mortality strongly relies on using a suitable modelling strategy that is capable of both capturing and assigning the sources of variation to the corresponding variables, which was best accomplished using a multi-level, binary, and Gompit-exposure modelling framework in this analysis.},

abstract={Drimys winteri es una especie muy abundante en los bosques naturales de Chile, conformando bosques secundarios de alto rendimiento entre las latitudes 41° y 43° S. La relación altura-diámetro es clave para realizar estimaciones de volumen, biomasa, y para entender características autoecológicas de las especies forestales. Sin embargo, esta relación alométrica ha sido poco investigada para esta especie. El objetivo del presente estudio fue modelar la relación altura-diámetro de D. winteri mediante modelos no-lineales de efectos mixtos. Se empleó una amplia base muestral de árboles entre las provincias de Llanquihue y Chiloé en el sur de Chile. Se analizaron diferentes modelos, y posteriormente se evaluó a qué parámetro(s) agregar efectos aleatorios. Finalmente, se modelaron dichos efectos en función de variables agregadas de rodal (e.g., densidad, área basal). Se propone un modelo que: posee un comportamiento biológicamente consistente; sus parámetros son estimados de forma eficiente al considerar la estructura jerárquica de los datos; e incluye el efecto de la competencia (representado por la densidad y diámetro del árbol de área basal media) y la calidad del sitio (representado por el incremento medio anual en altura dominante) de los bosques donde estos árboles crecen. Esto implica que la alometría altura-diámetro de D. winteri varía dependiendo de la competencia y productividad del sitio donde crece la especie, dos variables fundamentales de considerar en la toma de decisiones silvícolas.}

abstract={Self‐thinning and site maximum carrying capacity are key concepts for understanding and predicting ecosystem dynamics as they represent the outcome of several fundamental  ecological  processes  (e.g.,  mortality  and  growth). Relationships are often derived using alternative modeling strategies, depending on the statistical approach, model formulation, and underlying data with unclear implications of these various assumptions. In this analysis, the influence of contrasting modeling strategies for estimating the self‐thinning relationship and maximum carrying capacity in long‐term, permanent plot data (n = 130) from the mixed Nothofagus forests in southern Chile was assessed and compared. Seven contrasting modeling strategies were used including ordinary least squares, quantile, and nonlinear regression that were formulated based on static (no remeasurements) or dynamic data (with remeasurements). Statistically distinct differences among these seven approaches were identified with mean maximum carrying capacity ranging from 1050 to 1912 stems/ha depending on the approach. The population‐level static approach based on quantile regression produced an estimate closest to the overall mean with site‐level carrying capacity depending on tree species diversity and climate. Synthesis and applications. Overall, the findings highlight strong variability within and between contrasting methods of determining self‐thinning and site maximum carry capacity, which may influence ecological inferences.},

abstract={Binary variables have two possible outcomes: occurrence or non-occurrence of an event (usually with 1 and 0 values, respectively). Binary data are common in ecology, including studies of presence/absence, alive/dead, and change/no-change. Logistic regression analysis has been widely used to model binary response variables. Unbalanced data (i.e., an extremely larger proportion of zeros than ones) are often found across a variety of ecological datasets. Sometimes the data are balanced (i.e., same amount of zeros and ones) before fitting the model, however, the statistical implications of balancing (or not) the data remain unclear. We assessed the statistical effects of balancing data when fitting a logistic regression model by studying both its statistical properties of the estimated parameters and its predictive capabilities. We used a base forest-mortality model as reference, and by using stochastic simulations representing different configurations of 0/1 data in a sample (unbalanced data scenarios), we fitted the logistic regression model by maximum likelihood. For each scenario we computed the bias and variance of the estimated parameters and several prediction indexes. We found that the variability of the estimated parameters is affected, with the balanced-data scenario having the lowest variability, thus, affecting the statistical inference as well. Furthermore, the prediction capabilities of the model are altered by balancing the data, with the balanced-data scenario having the better sensitivity/specificity ratio. Balancing, or not, the data to be used for fitting a logistic regression models may affect the conclusion that can arise from the fitted model and its subsequent applications.},

	abstract={El crecimiento de los bosques es clave para entender su dinámica y para realizar un manejo sustentable en éstos. Si bien el crecimiento de un árbol se puede medir de forma relativamente fácil, el crecimiento de un bosque sólo se puede determinar al evaluar variables de estado (e.g. densidad, volumen) en unidades de muestreo permanentes en el tiempo. Debido al alto costo de mantenimiento de estudios a largo plazo, es difícil conocer antecedentes de crecimiento (p. ej. incremento, mortalidad y reclutamiento) de bosques naturales. Aunque existe una importante cantidad de estudios sobre la ecología y dinámica de bosques de segundo crecimiento (renovales) de Nothofagus, un seguimiento temporal de las variables de estado es sólo posible de encontrar en un reducido número de unidades de muestreo permanente en el centro-sur de Chile (37- 41 S). Este problema se ve aún más acentuado en bosques adultos de Nothofagus, donde la extrema escasez de este tipo de bosque, se suma a la poca investigación realizada en ellos. Dado lo anterior, este trabajo tiene por objetivo describir el crecimiento de bosques secundarios y adultos de Nothofagus en el centro-sur de Chile. Este trabajo se organiza en: (a) contextualizar una terminología apropiada sobre crecimiento de bosques, y (b) caracterizar ambos tipos de bosques en base a el más amplio grupo de unidades de muestreo permanente (74 en renovales y siete en bosques adultos) con evaluaciones temporales en términos de variables de estado, crecimiento, estructura diamétrica temporal, y patrones de distribución espacial. Este trabajo ofrece información cuantitativa para entender de mejor forma la dinámica de los bosques, como también para ayudar en una apropiada planificación de intervenciones silviculturales.},

We present an overview of the forest sector of Chile focused on forest resources, silviculture, economy, social and environmental aspects, and forestry education and research. The Chilean forest sector is internationally known for its success. Although this is one of the most important economic activities of Chile, management between exotic species plantations and natural forests is very asymmetric. Currently, highly intensive silviculture is applied to forest plantations of Pinus radiata (radiata pine) and Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus, Eucalyptus nitens) but only limited operational silviculture is applied to natural forests, even though there is considerable research to support it. There are still unresolved issues related to: conversion from natural forests to other land uses; pulp mills, and new efforts are needed from the government and large forestry companies to account for social and environmental demands. There is a good amount of university-level forestry education; however, there is an oversupply of professional foresters.},

	abstract={La biometría forestal ofrece herramientas cuantitativas de apoyo para el manejo e investigación científica de ecosistemas forestales. Aunque en Chile se ha avanzado de manera importante en diversos estudios ecológicos en bosques naturales, existen pocos modelos cuantitativos para el manejo silvicultural de estos. En el presente trabajo se revisan y analizan los principales estudios científicos-técnicos de biometría forestal realizados en bosques naturales. Este análisis se segrega de acuerdo a las siguientes principales divisiones de la biometría forestal: (a) muestreo, (b) modelos estáticos y (c) modelos dinámicos. El desarrollo de la biometría de los bosques nativos ha estado indudablemente relacionado con el avance tecnológico (e.g., computacional, sensores remotos) y nuevas metodologías estadísticas. Los primeros estudios hacían referencia a estudios relacionados principalmente con muestreo (los denominados inventarios forestales) y modelos estáticos (de volumen y altura-diámetro), para pasar paulatinamente a modelos de tipo dinámico (crecimiento). Para cada una de estas divisiones hay aplicaciones básicas, ya que son fundamentales para la caracterización de bosques y planificación de actividades silvícolas. Sin embargo, dichas aplicaciones poseen una serie de deficiencias, dentro de las cuales destacan: son desarrolladas en zonas geográficas reducidas y situaciones específicas; han sido preparadas con una base muestral reducida; y carecen de análisis del comportamiento de los modelos ajustados. Finalmente, se proponen algunas alternativas para organizar el trabajo de investigadores en biometría que en conjunto con silvicultores puedan finalmente contribuir a generar modelos cuantitativos de mayor validez estadística, biológica y práctica.},

abstract={Formerly, tree height has been more difficult to measure accurately in the field than tree diameter at breast height. As a consequence, models to predict height from diameter measurements have been widely developed in the forestry literature. Through the use of airborne laser scanning technology (e.g., LiDAR), tree variables such as height and crown diameter can be measured accurately, a development which has spawned the need for models to predict diameter from airborne laser-derived measurements. Although some work has been done for fitting such models, none have incorporated spatial information to improve the accuracy of the predicted diameters. Using a simple linear model for predicting tree diameter from laser-derived tree height and crown diameter measurements, we compared the performance of ordinary least squares (OLS), generalized least squares with a non-null correlation structure (GLS), linear mixed-effects model (LME), and geographically weighted regression (GWR). Our data were obtained from 36 sample plots established in Norway. This is the first study to examine the use of spatial statistical models for tree-level LiDAR data. Root mean square prediction errors in tree diameter with LME are 3.5%, with GWR are 10%, and with OLS and GLS are 17%. LME also exhibited low variability in predicting performance across all the validation classes (based on laser-derived height). Giving the difficulties of using parametric statistical inference (such as maximum likelihood-based indices) for GWR, we used permutation tests as a way for detecting statistical differences. LME was significantly better than the other models, as well as GWR was to OLS and GLS. Our results indicate that the LME model produced the best predictions of tree diameter from LiDAR-based variables to a degree that has previously not been possible.}

We evaluated the effect of measurement error (ME) in the auxiliary variate on the statistical performance of three ratio estimators of the target parameter total &tau;<sub>y</sub>. The analyzed estimators are: the ratio-of-means, mean-of-ratios, and an unbiased ratio estimator. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted over a population of more than 14,000 loblolly pine (*Pinus taeda* L.) trees, using tree volume ($v$) and diameter at breast height ($d$) as the target and auxiliary variables, respectively. In each simulation three different sample sizes were randomly selected. Based on the simulations, the effect of different types (systematic and random) and levels (low to high) of MEs in $x$ on the bias, variance, and mean square error of three ratio estimators was assessed. We also assessed the estimators of the variance of the ratio estimators. The ratio-of-means estimator had the smallest root mean square error. The mean-of-ratios estimator was found quite biased (20%).  When the MEs are random, neither the accuracy (i.e. bias) of any of the ratio estimators is greatly affected by type and level of ME nor its precision (i.e. variance). Positive systematic MEs decrease the bias but increase the variance of all the ratio estimators. Only the variance estimator of the ratio-of-means estimator is biased, being especially large for the smallest sample size, and larger for negative MEs, mainly if they are systematic.},

Aunque existen varios estudios ecológicos llevados a cabo en bosques de A. araucana, muy pocos han producido modelos cuantitativos. Se compararon métodos estadísticos paramétricos y no paramétricos para predecir variables de rodal en función de variables derivadas de Landsat ETM+ para dos rodales de A. araucana en el centro-sur de Chile. Los métodos paramétricos fueron regresión líneal múltiple (MLR), mínimos cuadrados generalizados con una estructura de correlación no nula (GLS), modelo lineal de efectos mixtos (LME) y mínimos cuadrados parciales (PLS); mientras que los métodos no paramétricos fueron: k-ésimo vecino más cercano ($k$-NN) y vecino más similar (MSN). En orden descendente, número de árboles por hectárea ($N$), volumen bruto ($V$), área basal ($G$) y altura dominante ($H_{dom}$), fueron las variables más complejas de modelar por todos los métodos. El modelo lineal de efectos mixtos con efectos aleatorios conocidos (LME1) tuvo el mejor desempeño, alcanzando una raíz cuadrada de las diferencias (RMSD) para $N$ y $V$ de 18,31 y 4,08 % versus 33,06 y 33,05 % para el segundo mejor método, respectivamente. Después de LME1, GLS se comportó mejor, y también toma en consideración la correlación espacial de los datos. Las diferencias fueron mayores entre métodos no paramétricos que para los paramétricos, con una diferencia de 10-15 % entre $k$-NN y MSN. Aunque los resultados obtenidos favorecen a los métodos paramétricos, se destaca que los métodos no paramétricos son también útiles, y la elección entre ambos métodos depende del objetivo del estudio.},

abstract={With auxiliary information that is well correlated with the primary variable of interest, ratio estimation of the finite population total may be much more efficient than alternative estimators that do not make use of the auxiliary variate. The well-known properties of ratio estimators are perturbed when the auxiliary variate is measured with error. In this contribution we examine the effect of measurement error in the auxiliary variate on the design-based statistical properties of three common ratio estimators. We examine the case of systematic measurement error as well as measurement error that varies according to a fixed distribution. Aside from presenting expressions for the bias and variance of these estimators when they are contaminated with measurement error we provide numerical results based on a specific population. Under systematic measurement error, the biasing effect is asymmetric around zero, and precision may be improved or degraded depending on the magnitude of the error. Under variable measurement error, bias of the conventional ratio-of-means estimator increased slightly with increasing error dispersion, but far less than the increased bias of the conventional mean-of-ratios estimator. In similar fashion, the variance of the mean-of-ratios estimator incurs a greater loss of precision with increasing error dispersion compared with the other estimators we examine. Overall, the ratio-of-means estimator appears to be remarkably resistant to the effects of measurement error in the auxiliary variate.}

The model predicts growth for all tree sizes continuously, rather than requiring a transition between independent models for juvenile and mature growth phases. The model predicts the effects of overstory and understory vegetative competition on height growth. Our model requires attained height rather than tree age as a predictor variable, thereby avoiding the problems of site index. Site effects are introduced as a function of ecological habitat type, elevation, aspect, and slope. We used six data sets totaling 3,785 trees in 314 plots. The structure of the data and the model indicated the need for a mixed-effects, nonlinear modeling approach using maximum likelihood in a linear differential equation with a power transformation. Behavior of the model was analyzed using a state-space approach. Our results show that both overstory and understory density affect height growth, allowing a manager to make informed decisions about vegetation control.},

The model formulation we propose integrates interactions of these three factors in a mathematical expression representing their combined effect in terms of a cosine function of aspect with a phase shift and amplitude that change with slope and elevation. This model allows the data to determine how the aspect effect changes with elevation and slope. Earlier articles concerning the interactions of slope, aspect, and elevation have been incomplete by either treating elevation as fixed or ignoring the possibility that aspect effect must also involve slope. The proposed set of variables is illustrated in four applications: (1) a hypothetical data set for probability of stocking by 'species' having different adaptations to elevation, (2) in a discriminant function for forest/nonforest classification of data from Utah, (3) estimating mean annual increment of Utah forests, and (4) estimating the height asymptote in a mixed-model differential equation predicting Douglas-fir height growth.},

    abstract={We used stem-analysis data from 60 to 100 years-old second-growth stands, and single-point observations in 260-460 years-old trees, to study and model height development of Nothofagus obliqua ('roble'). The data covers a much wider range of ages than previous work on this species. A stochastic differential equation approach facilitated the estimation and comparison of alternative model variants based on the Richards equation. A number of methodological issues in the application of stem-analysis techniques were examined. It was found that breast-height-age can improve the reliability of site quality assessment and growth projections, compared to the total or stump age currently used. Best results were obtained with a polymorphic model fitted to the stem-analysis observations, conditioning the asymptote to be compatible with the old-growth tree measurements.},

    abstract={Data from a 1 ha permanent sample plot in an old-growth Nothofagus obliqua dominated forest were used to study spatial patterns of dead and live trees using the Ripley's $K(t)$ function. Univariate and bivariate analyses were conducted. We computed confidence envelopes for a random (Poisson) spatial distribution using Monte Carlo simulations. An edge effect correction was applied. The spatial pattern of Aextoxicon   punctatum (the dominant species) changed from a random distribution at short spatial intervals of analysis to a clustered distribution at broader spatial scales. N. obliqua appeared to be more regularly distributed, but was not statistically significantly different from a random distribution at 95% confidence. There was a negative interaction (i.e. repulsion) between shorter (generally younger than 100 years) and taller (generally older than 250 years) trees. On the other hand, there was a positive interaction (i.e. attraction) between shorter, younger trees and standing dead trees.},

To obtain the best volume equation the following four steps were taken: the test on statistical assumptions’ satisfaction, model ranking according to their goodness of fitting, model ranking according to their prediction accuracy, and finally, an analysis of the models prediction capacity within the range of volumetric classes. The fitted models were validated using an independent sample dataset. The selected model showed a root of mean squared errors (RMSE) of 7.77% and a bias (DA) of 0.25%. These values are notably smaller than the error and bias obtained using the fitted model from the national forest inventories for the province of Pontevedra which uses the same number of independent variables (diameter at breast height, total height and upper-stem diameter at 4 m). In addition, the proposed model was the only one that satisfied the statistical assumptions that support the regression analysis.}

    abstract="Using a non-destructive method based on the Bitterlich mirror relascope, we determined the total volume of individual trees in a relict native forest named Rucamanque, which is located in the IX region of Chile. Based on these estimations, equations relating volume were fitted. The seven species were grouped using a covariance analysis. After this analysis, four groups were chosen: 1. Laurel (Laurelia sempervirens), Lingue (Persea lingue), Tepa (Laureliopsis philipiana); 2. Ulmo (Eucryphia cordifolia) with DBH $<=$ 60 cm, Olivillo (Aextoxicon punctatum); 3. Roble (Nothofagus obliqua), and 4. Ulmo with DBH $>$ 60 cm, Tineo (Weinmannia trichosperma). To obtain the best volume equation for each species group, the following four steps were taken: fulfillment of statistical assumptions, models ranked according to goodness of fit, models ranked according to prediction capabilities and, finally, an analysis of the prediction capabilities of the models within diameter classes. The quadratic mean error (ECM) presented by the selected equations ranged from 15\% to 24\%, mainly influenced by the amplitude of fit range and the large natural variability of the volume in the larger diameter classes.",

Se describen las principales características del predio Rucamanque, con énfasis en la caracterización de algunos aspectos silvícolas del bosque adulto multietáneo conformado por olivillo, roble, ulmo, laurel y lingue, el cual alcanza los 97 m$^2$/ha de área basal y sobrepasa los 1.000 m$^3$/ha en volumen bruto total. Debido a la pristinidad del ecosistema boscoso de Rucamanque, es posible encontrar en su interior algunas especies, tanto vegetales como animales, que presentan algún problema de conservación. El resguardo del predio por parte de la Universidad de La Frontera, permite asegurar la conservación de este ecosistema único, con el objetivo de servir de testigo y ser objeto de estudio, no sólo en silvicultura sino que también para diversas ciencias.},
